# P.S
* I choose MVVM. Because, that is a very simple 2 screens app, I didn't want to set up a complex architecture. And, my knowledge of MVVM is much more than others. If I use VIPER pattern, there will be so many files for two screens app.
* Due to my job, I couldn't focus on the challenge so much. I had less than 2 days in order to complete it. But if I had much more time, I would improve my code like below;
* I used two different table view managers which are "HomeTableViewManager" and "PostDetailTableViewManager". It should be a generic table view manager.
* I would develop an indicator view for API calls, a placeholder view for empty data states.
* I would add UI, Snapshot and Unit test
* I could use Result pattern on Network Layer. And, my NetworkLayer needs much more development.
* I forgot to create development branch.
* I am looking forward to get your feedbacks in order to improve my techinal skills. You can reach me via email :)
